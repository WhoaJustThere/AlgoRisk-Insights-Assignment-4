# AlgoRisk-Insights-Assignment-4
### Problem 1. 
You are tasked with constructing an optimal portfolio using historical data of the top 5 stocks over the past five years. You aim to maximize portfolio returns while considering risk factors such as the Sharpe ratio, beta, and efficient frontier.  
Outline the steps you would take to complete this, including data collection, preprocessing, portfolio construction, performance metrics calculation, efficient frontier analysis, portfolio optimization, and reporting.    

(a) Calculate the ‘Beta’ of each stock. Choose the time period and give reasons for the selected time frame  
(b) Calculate the weighted average Beta of the portfolio, assuming weight in the percentage of each stock in the portfolio is proportional to the market capitalization of that stock (Time frame: same as above)  
(c) Calculate the expected return of each stock as well as the portfolio using the CAPM model  
(d) Construct an efficient frontier for the portfolio such that it gives the highest Sharpe Ratio  

### Problem 2.
Implementation of trailing stop loss in your existing strategy:  
Compare the risk parameters without take profit and stop-loss, with taking profit and stop-loss, and lastly, with just trailing stop loss. A trailing stop loss is a type of stop loss order that adjusts automatically to a predefined percentage or dollar amount as the price of a security moves in your favor. Unlike a regular stop loss, which remains fixed at a certain price level, a trailing stop loss follows the price direction, aiming to lock in profits while limiting potential losses.
Implement the stop loss for both short trades and long trades.

### Problem 3.

Implement these tests on a time series of stock data and report the analysis of outcomes of these tests.

(a) ADF test  
(b) KPSS test  
(c) Ljung-Box test  
(d) Granger causality test  
(e) Durbin-Watson Test
